# leads-tracker-js
project from scrimba js  course

Learning Objectives:
- Use of const vs let
- Use of addEventListener instead of onclick() to add multiple events to particular element depending on user action; however does not work on older internet explorer browsers
- Use of function parameters for more organized and 'cleaner' looking code; better for debugging
- template strings for better readability
- localStorage to save data locally 
- JSON object i.e. parse and stringify to transmit data in web applications (i.e. chrome extension)
- accessing objects in arrays
